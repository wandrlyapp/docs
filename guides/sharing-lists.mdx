## Share a list

1. Go to your dashboard
2. Find the list you want to share
3. Click **"Invite"**
4. Choose an access level (see below)
5. Click **"Copy shareable link"**
6. Send the link via email, text, WhatsApp, or any messaging app

Your recipients can access the list through the link you send them.

## Choose the right access level

### View access

Recipients can:

- See all the places you've added
- View notes, tags, and details
- See the map and place locations

Recipients cannot:

- Add new places
- Edit existing places
- Delete places

**Best for:** Sharing your itinerary with travel companions who just need to see your plans.

### Edit access

Recipients can:

- Add new places to the list
- Edit existing places (notes, tags, priority)
- Delete places from the list
- View who added each place

**Best for:** Collaborative trip planning with friends or family where everyone contributes ideas.

## Working together

When multiple people have edit access, you can all plan together in real-time.

**What you can see:**

- Who added each place (shown in the place details)
- All updates made by collaborators
- The complete shared list on your dashboard

**Collaboration tips:**

- Use tags to identify who suggested what ("John's picks," "Mom's recommendations")
- Set priorities together to agree on must-see spots
- Add notes explaining why you want to visit each place
- Mark places as visited so everyone knows what's been done

## Managing shared lists

### Lists you created

When you create a list and share it, it appears in your "Created by me" section on the dashboard. You control who has access.

### Lists shared with you

Lists others have shared with you appear in your "Shared with me" section. Your ability to edit depends on the access level the owner gave you.

### View all lists

Click "All" on your dashboard to see both your lists and shared lists in one view.

## Removing access

If you created a list and want to remove someone's access, go to the list settings and manage collaborators. You can change access levels or remove people at any time.
