## Adding notes

Notes help you remember why you wanted to visit a place or capture important details.

**To add notes:**

1. Click on a place in your list
2. Select **"Edit notes"** or **"View details"**
3. Type your notes in the text field
4. Your notes are automatically saved

**What to include in notes:**

- Friend recommendations ("Sarah said to try the tacos")
- Specific menu items or dishes
- Opening hours or best times to visit
- Reservation requirements
- Parking information
- Budget estimates

## Adding tags

Tags help you categorize places so you can filter them later.

**To add tags:**

1. Click on a place in your list
2. Find the tag field
3. Start typing to create a new tag or select an existing one
4. Press enter to add the tag

**Helpful tag ideas:**

- **Weather-based:** Indoor, Outdoor, Covered patio
- **Activity type:** Active, Relaxing, Cultural
- **Occasion:** Date night, Family-friendly, For kids, Solo travel
- **Budget:** Budget-friendly, Splurge, Free
- **Meal type:** Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Coffee
- **Who suggested:** John's picks, Mom's recommendations

**Tag tips:**

- Create tags as you add places, not all at once later
- Use consistent naming (decide on "For kids" vs "Kid-friendly")
- Don't over-tag - 2-3 tags per place is usually enough
- Think about how you'll want to filter later

## Setting priority levels

Priority levels help you identify which places matter most when time is limited.

**To set priority:**

1. Click on a place in your list
2. Find the priority dropdown
3. Select your priority level

**Priority options:**

- **High** - Must-see, top priority places
- **Medium** - Would like to visit if possible
- **Low** - Nice to visit if you have extra time

**When to use each level:**

**High priority:**

- Famous landmarks you can't miss
- Highly recommended restaurants
- Time-sensitive experiences
- Main reasons you're visiting the city

**Medium priority:**

- Interesting but not essential
- Backup options
- Places you'd visit on a return trip

**Low priority:**

- "If we have time" options
- Things that seemed cool but aren't crucial
- Places close to other activities

## Getting directions

When you're ready to visit a place, you can open directions in Google Maps.

**To get directions:**

1. Click on a place in your list
2. Select **"Directions"**
3. Google Maps will open with directions from your current location

This makes it easy to navigate to places directly from your Wandrly list.

## Marking places as visited

Track your progress by marking places you've been to as visited.

**To mark as visited:**

1. Click on a place in your list
2. Toggle the "Visited" status

**What happens when you mark a place as visited:**

- A checkmark icon appears on the map
- You can filter by visited/not visited status
- You can see your progress through the list

**Pro tip:** Mark places as visited during your trip to keep track in real-time.

## Viewing place details

Each place shows:

- Place name and type
- Address
- Priority level
- Tags you've added
- Notes you've written
- Visited status
- Who added the place (in shared lists)

**To view all details:**

- Click **"View details"** on any place in your list

## Editing existing details

All details can be edited at any time:

- Click on a place to open the details
- Update any field
- Changes save automatically

You can also remove tags, change priorities, or clear notes whenever needed.

## Map view indicators

Your customizations are reflected on the map:

- Different icons show place types (restaurants, museums, etc.)
- Checkmarks appear on visited places
- All your saved places are visible at once

## Best practices

**Add details as you add places:** Don't save a bunch of places and plan to add details later. Add notes and tags immediately while you're thinking about the place.

**Be specific in notes:** Instead of "looks good," write "Known for BBQ brisket, get there early." Future you will appreciate specifics.

**Use priority levels honestly:** If everything is high priority, nothing is. Be realistic about what you can actually do.

**Update as you go:** If you visit a place and it was amazing (or disappointing), add notes about your experience.

**Tag for scenarios:** Think about real situations ("what if it rains?") and tag accordingly.
