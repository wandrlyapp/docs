## Accessing filters

Look for the filter menu at the top of your list page. Click it to see all available filter options.

## Filter types

### Priority level

Filter by how interested you are in visiting a place:

- **High** - Must-see places, top priorities
- **Medium** - Would like to visit
- **Low** - Nice to visit if you have time

**Example use:** Show only "High" priority places when you have limited time in a city.

### Visited status

Filter by whether you've been to a place:

- **Visited** - Places you've already been to
- **Not visited** - Places you haven't visited yet

**Example use:** Show only "Not visited" places to see what's left on your list.

### Tags

Filter by any custom tags you've created:

- Indoor
- Outdoor
- Kid-friendly
- Date night
- Budget-friendly
- Active
- Any other tags you've added

**Example use:** Show only "Indoor" places on a rainy day.

## Using filters

1. Click the filter menu at the top of your list
2. Select the filters you want to apply
3. Click **"Apply"**
4. Your list and map will update to show only matching places

To see all places again, click **"Clear filters"**.

## Combining filters

You can combine multiple filters to get specific results.

### **Example combinations**

**Planning a rainy day:**

- Priority: High
- Tags: Indoor
- Visited: Not visited
- Result: Must-see indoor places you haven't been to yet

**Seeing what you've accomplished:**

- Priority: High
- Visited: Visited
- Result: All the top priorities you've already checked off

**Last-minute planning:**

- Priority: High + Medium
- Visited: Not visited
- Result: Everything worth doing that you haven't done yet

## What gets filtered

When you apply filters, both your list view and map view update:

- **List panel (left side):** Shows only matching places
- **Map view:** Shows only matching place markers (pins)

This makes it easy to see your filtered results both as a list and geographically.

## Tips for effective filtering

**Create useful tags early:** The more descriptive your tags, the more helpful filtering becomes.

**Use priority levels consistently:** Make sure you're setting priorities on places as you add them.

**Mark places as visited during your trip:** This keeps your "Not visited" filter accurate and useful.

**Combine filters for specific scenarios:** Think about situations you'll encounter (bad weather, limited time, kids are tired) and filter accordingly.
