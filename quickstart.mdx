### Step 1: Create your first list

When you log in to your Wandrly account, you'll see the dashboard page where all your lists are displayed.

### To create a new list:

1. Click the **"Create a new list"** button on your dashboard
2. Give your list a name (this is typically the city or destination you're planning to visit)
   - Example: "Austin," "Nashville," "Paris," etc.
3. Click **"Create list"**

Your new list will appear on your dashboard, and you can click on it to start adding places.

### Setting Your Start Location

The first time you open a new list, Wandrly will ask you to set a start location. This serves as the center point for your map and can be:

- The name of the city you're visiting
- Your hotel address
- Your Airbnb location
- Any central location in the area

Simply type in the location and it will be added as your home base for the list.

### Step 2: Add your first saved place

Once you've set your start location, you can begin adding places to your list.

### To add a place:

1. Use the search bar to look for places in your destination
2. Click on the place you want to add
3. The place will be added to your list and appear on the map

### Understanding the Map Icons

Wandrly uses different icons to help you identify types of attractions:

- **Museums** - Museum icon
- **Points of Interest** - Star icon
- **Restaurants, Activities, and more** - Each category has its own distinct icon

These visual markers make it easy to see at a glance what types of places you've saved.

### Dashboard Organization

From your dashboard, you can:

- View **All** your lists
- Filter by **lists you've created**
- Filter by **lists shared with you**

Use the sorting buttons at the top of your dashboard to organize your view.

### Step 3: Set details for your saved places

### Step 4: Filter through your saved places

### Step 5 (Optionally): Share with friends & family
