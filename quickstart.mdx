## Step 1: Create your first list

When you log in to your Wandrly account, you'll see the dashboard page where all your lists are displayed.

### To create a new list:

1. Click the **"Create a new list"** button on your dashboard
2. Give your list a name (this is typically the city or destination you're planning to visit, but it can be whatever you want it to be)
   - Example: "Austin," "Nashville," "Paris," etc.
3. Click **"Create list"**

Your new list will appear on your dashboard, and you can click on it to start adding places.

### Setting Your start location

The first time you open a new list, Wandrly will ask you to set a start location. This serves as the center point for your map and can be:

- The name of the city you're visiting
- Your hotel address
- Your Airbnb location
- Any central location in the area

Simply type in the location, and it will be added as your home base for the list.

## Step 2: Add your first saved place

Once you've set your start location, you can begin adding places to your list.

### To add a place:

1. Use the search bar to look for places in your destination
2. Click on the place you want to add
3. The place will be added to your list and appear on the map

### Understanding the map icons

Wandrly uses different icons to help you identify types of attractions:

- **Museums** - Museum icon
- **Points of Interest** - Star icon
- **Restaurants, Activities, and more** - Each category has its own distinct icon

These visual markers make it easy to see at a glance what types of places you've saved.

## Step 3: Set details for your saved places

Adding details to your saved places helps you remember why you wanted to visit that place and organize your trip better.

### Adding notes

1. Click on a place in your list
2. Select **"Edit notes"** or **"View details"**
3. Type your notes (recommendations from friends, specific dishes to try, opening hours, etc.)
4. Your notes are automatically saved

### Adding tags

Tags help you categorize places for easy filtering later.

**To add a tag:**

1. Click on a place in your list
2. Select the tag field
3. Either:
   - Choose from existing tags you've created (existing tags will show as you start typing)
   - Create a new tag by typing it in

**Useful tag examples:**

- "Indoors" (for bad weather options)
- "Kid-friendly" (family-friendly spots)
- "Active" (hiking, sports, outdoor activities)
- "Date night" (romantic venues)
- "Budget-friendly" (affordable options)

### Setting priority levels

Priority levels help you organize places by how much you want to visit them.

**To set priority:**

1. Click on a place
2. Find the priority dropdown menu
3. Choose from:
   - **Low** - Nice to visit if you have time
   - **Medium** - Would like to visit
   - **High** - Must-see, top priority

### Marking places as visited

After you've been to a place:

1. Click on the place in your list
2. Mark it as **"Visited"**
3. The map will show a checkmark icon on visited places

This helps you keep track of where you've been and what you still want to explore.

## Step 4: Filter through your saved places

As your list grows, filtering becomes essential for finding exactly what you're looking for.

### Using filters

Access the filter menu at the top of your list page. You can filter by:

**Priority level**

- Show only High, Medium, or Low priority places

**Visited status**

- Places you've visited
- Places you haven't visited yet

**Tags**

- Filter by any tags you've created
- Example: Show only "Indoors" places for a rainy day

### Combining filters

You can combine multiple filters to narrow down your search:

- **Example 1:** High priority + Not visited = Your must-see places you haven't been to yet
- **Example 2:** Active tag + Not visited = Outdoor activities still on your list

After applying filters, your list and map will update to show only matching places. Click **"Clear filters"** to see all your places again.

## Step 5 (Optionally): Share with friends & family

Wandrly makes it easy to share your lists or collaborate on trip planning with others.

### Sharing a List

1. Go to your dashboard
2. Find the list you want to share
3. Click **"Invite"**

### Choosing access levels

You have two sharing options:

**View access**

- Recipients can see all the places you've added
- They can view notes, tags, and details
- They cannot add, edit, or delete places
- Perfect for: Sharing your lists with travel companions who aren't planning

**Edit access**

- Recipients can add new places
- They can edit existing places
- They can delete places
- Perfect for: Collaborative trip planning with friends or family

### Sharing the link

1. Choose the appropriate access level (View or Edit)
2. Click **"Copy shareable link"**
3. Send the link via:
   - Email
   - Text message
   - WhatsApp
   - Any messaging platform

Your invited collaborators will be able to access the list through the link. If they have edit access, you'll see who added each place in the place details.
